Clone the official project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/AzDevOpsDemoGenerator

Navigate into the project's source directory. If needed, you can modify the `scope` property within the `appsettings.json` file to adjust the permissions the application will request.

brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
```

Navigate to the project's source directory (`src/ADOGenerator`) if you aren't already there, and run the restore command to download the necessary packages.

```bash
cd src/ADOGenerator
dotnet restore
```

If you receive an error about a missing framework during the next steps, you may need to install the .NET runtime manually.

* **Download Link for macOS ARM64**: [Microsoft .NET 8.0.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
